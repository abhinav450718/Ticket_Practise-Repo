## Introduction

`jq` is a lightweight and powerful command-line JSON processor used to **read, parse, filter, transform, and manipulate JSON data**.
It is designed to work seamlessly inside terminals, shell scripts, automation pipelines, and cloud-native systems where JSON is dominant.

## Why jq?

JSON is the de-facto data format across:

* REST APIs
* Cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP)
* Kubernetes manifests
* Tools like Docker, Terraform, Jenkins, Ansible
* Log and config files

~jq is used because:

* It removes the need to manually read messy JSON
* Allows instant extraction of key information
* Helps automate workflows and reduce script complexity
* Makes debugging and data validation easier
* Works flawlessly with pipes and CLI outputs
